// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, 
// countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing 
// these items.

// Making programing language store in Array
let programingLanguages:string[] = ["Typescript","Javascript","Python","C++"];
// print the message
console.log("\nList of programingLanguages: ");
// print the value of Array in the form of list
programingLanguages.forEach(languages => console.log(languages));
