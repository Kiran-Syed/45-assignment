//  If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
//  just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing
//   what the program does.
var num1 = 20;
var num2 = 10;
//  Adding the value of num1 and num2 (This is the comment that cannot read by typescript.)
